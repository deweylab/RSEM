DESCRIPTION
       Samtools  is  a  set of utilities that manipulate alignments in the BAM
       format. It imports from and exports to the SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map)
       format,  does  sorting,  merging  and  indexing, and allows to retrieve
       reads in any regions swiftly.

       Samtools is designed to work on a stream. It regards an input file  `-'
       as  the  standard  input (stdin) and an output file `-' as the standard
       output (stdout). Several commands can thus be combined with Unix pipes.
       Samtools always output warning and error messages to the standard error
       output (stderr).

       Samtools is also able to open a BAM (not SAM) file on a remote  FTP  or
       HTTP  server  if  the  BAM file name starts with `ftp://' or `http://'.
       Samtools checks the current working directory for the  index  file  and
       will  download  the  index upon absence. Samtools does not retrieve the
       entire alignment file unless it is asked to do so.


COMMANDS AND OPTIONS
       view      samtools  view  [-bhuHS]  [-t  in.refList]  [-o  output]  [-f
                 reqFlag]  [-F  skipFlag]  [-q minMapQ] [-l library] [-r read-
                 Group] [-R rgFile] <in.bam>|<in.sam> [region1 [...]]

                 Extract/print all or sub alignments in SAM or BAM format.  If
                 no  region  is specified, all the alignments will be printed;
                 otherwise only alignments overlapping the  specified  regions
                 will  be  output. An alignment may be given multiple times if
                 it is overlapping several regions. A region can be presented,
                 for  example,  in  the  following  format:  `chr2' (the whole
                 chr2), `chr2:1000000' (region starting from  1,000,000bp)  or
                 `chr2:1,000,000-2,000,000'   (region  between  1,000,000  and
                 2,000,000bp including the  end  points).  The  coordinate  is
                 1-based.

                 OPTIONS:

                 -b      Output in the BAM format.

                 -u      Output uncompressed BAM. This option saves time spent
                         on compression/decomprssion  and  is  thus  preferred
                         when the output is piped to another samtools command.

                 -h      Include the header in the output.

                 -H      Output the header only.

                 -S      Input is in SAM. If @SQ header lines are absent,  the
                         `-t' option is required.

                 -t FILE This  file  is  TAB-delimited. Each line must contain
                         the reference name and the length of  the  reference,
                         one  line  for  each  distinct  reference; additional
                         fields are ignored. This file also defines the  order
                         of  the  reference  sequences  in sorting. If you run
                         `samtools faidx <ref.fa>', the resultant  index  file
                         <ref.fa>.fai  can be used as this <in.ref_list> file.

                 -o FILE Output file [stdout]

                 -f INT  Only output alignments with all bits in  INT  present
                         in the FLAG field. INT can be in hex in the format of
                         /^0x[0-9A-F]+/ [0]

                 -F INT  Skip alignments with bits present in INT [0]

                 -q INT  Skip alignments with MAPQ smaller than INT [0]

                 -l STR  Only output reads in library STR [null]

                 -r STR  Only output reads in read group STR [null]

                 -R FILE Output reads in read groups listed in FILE [null]


       tview     samtools tview <in.sorted.bam> [ref.fasta]

                 Text alignment viewer (based on the ncurses library). In  the
                 viewer,  press `?' for help and press `g' to check the align-
                 ment   start   from   a   region   in   the    format    like
                 `chr10:10,000,000'  or  `=10,000,000'  when  viewing the same
                 reference sequence.


       pileup    samtools  pileup  [-f  in.ref.fasta]  [-t  in.ref_list]   [-l
                 in.site_list]    [-iscgS2]   [-T   theta]   [-N   nHap]   [-r
                 pairDiffRate] <in.bam>|<in.sam>

                 Print the alignment in the pileup format. In the pileup  for-
                 mat,  each  line represents a genomic position, consisting of
                 chromosome name, coordinate, reference base, read bases, read
                 qualities  and  alignment  mapping  qualities. Information on
                 match, mismatch, indel, strand, mapping quality and start and
                 end  of  a  read  are all encoded at the read base column. At
                 this column, a dot stands for a match to the  reference  base
                 on  the  forward  strand,  a comma for a match on the reverse
                 strand, `ACGTN' for a mismatch  on  the  forward  strand  and
                 `acgtn'  for  a  mismatch  on  the  reverse strand. A pattern
                 `\+[0-9]+[ACGTNacgtn]+'  indicates  there  is  an   insertion
                 between  this reference position and the next reference posi-
                 tion. The length of the insertion is given by the integer  in
                 the  pattern, followed by the inserted sequence. Similarly, a
                 pattern `-[0-9]+[ACGTNacgtn]+' represents a deletion from the
                 reference.  The deleted bases will be presented as `*' in the
                 following lines. Also at the read base column, a  symbol  `^'
                 marks  the start of a read segment which is a contiguous sub-
                 sequence on the read separated by `N/S/H'  CIGAR  operations.
                 The  ASCII  of the character following `^' minus 33 gives the
                 mapping quality. A symbol `$' marks the end of  a  read  seg-
                 ment.

                 If  option  -c  is  applied, the consensus base, Phred-scaled
                 consensus quality, SNP quality (i.e. the Phred-scaled  proba-
                 bility of the consensus being identical to the reference) and
                 root mean square (RMS) mapping quality of the reads  covering
                 the  site  will  be inserted between the `reference base' and
                 the `read bases' columns. An  indel  occupies  an  additional
                 line.  Each  indel  line consists of chromosome name, coordi-
                 nate, a star, the genotype, consensus quality,  SNP  quality,
                 RMS mapping quality, # covering reads, the first alllele, the
                 second allele, # reads supporting the first allele,  #  reads
                 supporting  the  second  allele and # reads containing indels
                 different from the top two alleles.

                 The position of indels is offset by -1.

                 OPTIONS:

                 -s        Print the mapping quality as the last column.  This
                           option  makes  the output easier to parse, although
                           this format is not space efficient.

                 -S        The input file is in SAM.

                 -i        Only output pileup lines containing indels.

                 -f FILE   The reference sequence in the FASTA  format.  Index
                           file FILE.fai will be created if absent.

                 -M INT    Cap mapping quality at INT [60]

                 -m INT    Filter  reads  with  flag  containing  bits  in INT
                           [1796]

                 -d INT    Use the first NUM reads in  the  pileup  for  indel
                           calling for speed up. Zero for unlimited. [0]

                 -t FILE   List  of  reference  names ane sequence lengths, in
                           the format described for  the  import  command.  If
                           this  option is present, samtools assumes the input
                           <in.alignment>  is  in  SAM  format;  otherwise  it
                           assumes in BAM format.

                 -l FILE   List  of sites at which pileup is output. This file
                           is space  delimited.  The  first  two  columns  are
                           required  to  be chromosome and 1-based coordinate.
                           Additional columns are ignored. It  is  recommended
                           to use option -s together with -l as in the default
                           format we may not know the mapping quality.

                 -c        Call the consensus sequence using SOAPsnp consensus
                           model. Options -T, -N, -I and -r are only effective
                           when -c or -g is in use.

                 -g        Generate genotype likelihood in  the  binary  GLFv3
                           format. This option suppresses -c, -i and -s.

                 -T FLOAT  The  theta parameter (error dependency coefficient)
                           in the maq consensus calling model [0.85]

                 -N INT    Number of haplotypes in the sample (>=2) [2]

                 -r FLOAT  Expected fraction of differences between a pair  of
                           haplotypes [0.001]

                 -I INT    Phred  probability  of an indel in sequencing/prep.
                           [40]


       mpileup   samtools mpileup [-r reg] [-f in.fa] in.bam [in2.bam [...]]

                 Generate pileup for multiple BAM files. Consensus calling  is
                 not implemented.

                 OPTIONS:

                 -r STR  Only generate pileup in region STR [all sites]

                 -f FILE The reference file [null]


       reheader  samtools reheader <in.header.sam> <in.bam>

                 Replace   the   header   in   in.bam   with   the  header  in
                 in.header.sam.  This command is much  faster  than  replacing
                 the header with a BAM->SAM->BAM conversion.


       sort      samtools sort [-no] [-m maxMem] <in.bam> <out.prefix>

                 Sort  alignments  by  leftmost  coordinates.  File  <out.pre-
                 fix>.bam will be created. This command may also create tempo-
                 rary  files <out.prefix>.%d.bam when the whole alignment can-
                 not be fitted into memory (controlled by option -m).

                 OPTIONS:

                 -o      Output the final alignment to the standard output.

                 -n      Sort by read names rather than by chromosomal coordi-
                         nates

                 -m INT  Approximately    the    maximum    required   memory.
                         [500000000]


       merge     samtools  merge  [-h  inh.sam]  [-nr]   <out.bam>   <in1.bam>
                 <in2.bam> [...]

                 Merge multiple sorted alignments.  The header reference lists
                 of all the input BAM files, and the @SQ headers  of  inh.sam,
                 if  any,  must  all  refer  to  the  same  set  of  reference
                 sequences.  The header reference list and (unless  overridden
                 by  -h) `@' headers of in1.bam will be copied to out.bam, and
                 the headers of other files will be ignored.

                 OPTIONS:

                 -h FILE Use the lines of FILE as `@' headers to be copied  to
                         out.bam, replacing any header lines that would other-
                         wise be copied from in1.bam.  (FILE  is  actually  in
                         SAM  format, though any alignment records it may con-
                         tain are ignored.)

                 -r      Attach an RG tag to each alignment. The tag value  is
                         inferred from file names.

                 -n      The  input alignments are sorted by read names rather
                         than by chromosomal coordinates


       index     samtools index <aln.bam>

                 Index sorted alignment for fast  random  access.  Index  file
                 <aln.bam>.bai will be created.


       idxstats  samtools idxstats <aln.bam>

                 Retrieve and print stats in the index file. The output is TAB
                 delimited with each line  consisting  of  reference  sequence
                 name, sequence length, # mapped reads and # unmapped reads.


       faidx     samtools faidx <ref.fasta> [region1 [...]]

                 Index  reference sequence in the FASTA format or extract sub-
                 sequence from indexed reference sequence.  If  no  region  is
                 specified,   faidx   will   index   the   file   and   create
                 <ref.fasta>.fai on the disk. If regions are speficified,  the
                 subsequences  will  be retrieved and printed to stdout in the
                 FASTA format. The input file can be compressed  in  the  RAZF
                 format.


       fixmate   samtools fixmate <in.nameSrt.bam> <out.bam>

                 Fill in mate coordinates, ISIZE and mate related flags from a
                 name-sorted alignment.


       rmdup     samtools rmdup [-sS] <input.srt.bam> <out.bam>

                 Remove potential PCR duplicates: if multiple read pairs  have
                 identical  external  coordinates,  only  retain the pair with
                 highest mapping quality.  In the paired-end mode,  this  com-
                 mand  ONLY  works  with  FR orientation and requires ISIZE is
                 correctly set. It does not work for unpaired reads (e.g.  two
                 ends mapped to different chromosomes or orphan reads).

                 OPTIONS:

                 -s      Remove  duplicate  for  single-end reads. By default,
                         the command works for paired-end reads only.

                 -S      Treat paired-end reads and single-end reads.


       calmd     samtools calmd [-eubS] <aln.bam> <ref.fasta>

                 Generate the MD tag. If the MD tag is already  present,  this
                 command  will  give a warning if the MD tag generated is dif-
                 ferent from the existing tag. Output SAM by default.

                 OPTIONS:

                 -e      Convert a the read base to = if it  is  identical  to
                         the  aligned  reference  base.  Indel caller does not
                         support the = bases at the moment.

                 -u      Output uncompressed BAM

                 -b      Output compressed BAM

                 -S      The input is SAM with header lines


SAM FORMAT
       SAM is TAB-delimited. Apart from the header lines,  which  are  started
       with the `@' symbol, each alignment line consists of:


       +----+-------+----------------------------------------------------------+

       Each bit in the FLAG field is defined as:

          | Flag  | Chr |                   Description                    |
          +-------+-----+--------------------------------------------------+
          |0x0001 |  p  | the read is paired in sequencing                 |
          |0x0002 |  P  | the read is mapped in a proper pair              |
          |0x0004 |  u  | the query sequence itself is unmapped            |
          |0x0008 |  U  | the mate is unmapped                             |
          |0x0010 |  r  | strand of the query (1 for reverse)              |
          |0x0020 |  R  | strand of the mate                               |
          |0x0040 |  1  | the read is the first read in a pair             |
          |0x0080 |  2  | the read is the second read in a pair            |
          |0x0100 |  s  | the alignment is not primary                     |
          |0x0200 |  f  | the read fails platform/vendor quality checks    |
          |0x0400 |  d  | the read is either a PCR or an optical duplicate |
          +-------+-----+--------------------------------------------------+

LIMITATIONS
       o Unaligned   words  used  in  bam_import.c,  bam_endian.h,  bam.c  and
         bam_aux.c.

       o In merging, the input files are required to have the same  number  of
         reference  sequences.  The  requirement  can be relaxed. In addition,
         merging does not reconstruct the header  dictionaries  automatically.
         Endusers  have  to  provide  the  correct header. Picard is better at
         merging.

       o Samtools paired-end rmdup does not  work  for  unpaired  reads  (e.g.
         orphan  reads  or ends mapped to different chromosomes). If this is a
         concern, please use Picard's MarkDuplicate  which  correctly  handles
         these cases, although a little slower.
